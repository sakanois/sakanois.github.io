The last WOD that I completed was the Invoice 1 WOD. This WOD was about using JavaScript expressions to dynamically compute variables, rather than “hard coding” them. I had a more difficult time with this WOD than the other WODs since I am still not that confident with JavaScript yet. I did not record myself when I went through the WOD for the first time. I found watching the screencast after trying it out myself and then following along with the screencast without recording or timing myself helped me. The part that slowed me down was remembering where to put the <script> tags for a document.write(). To prepare I reviewed the slides on expressions and operators. Similar to last time, I reviewed the finished code before deleting it and studied the notes I took from the screencast for the parts that I was having trouble with. To be more prepared, I could have reviewed the labs that we completed in class. Next time, I want to stop relying so heavily on the screencast and try to use the lecture slides and readings when I get stuck. I also will keep recording even after I mess up and try to figure out where I went wrong before starting over completely and rewatching the attempt.
